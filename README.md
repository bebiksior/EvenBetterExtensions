`EvenBetter: Extensions` allows you to quicky install and keep updated Caido extensions.

# This is DEV version, it's not fully done yet. The stable version will be out in a few days.

## Installation
**Note**: If you are moving from EvenBetter to EvenBetterExtensions, please remove the EvenBetter Custom CSS. 

1. In Caido, go to **Settings** and then navigate to the **Developer** section
2. Copy the entire content from https://github.com/bebiksior/EvenBetterExtensions/blob/main/final/index.js and paste it into the `Custom JS`
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰ There's no need to add custom CSS anymore.
